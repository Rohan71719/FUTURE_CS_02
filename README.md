# Social Engineering & Phishing Simulation using SET
**Author**: Rohan Sen  
**Project**: TASK-02 — Cybersecurity Awareness & Simulation  
**Tool Used**: Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)  
**Platform**: Kali Linux

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how social engineering attacks, specifically **phishing**, are simulated using the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) in Kali Linux. The goal is to raise awareness about common manipulation techniques and illustrate how attackers can exploit human psychology to steal sensitive information.

## 🧠 What is Social Engineering?

Social engineering is a form of manipulation that tricks individuals into divulging confidential data or performing actions that compromise security. These attacks rely on human behavior, emotions, and lack of awareness rather than software vulnerabilities.

### 🎯 Goals of Social Engineering:
- **Theft**: Gain unauthorized access, credentials, or money.
- **Sabotage**: Disrupt or corrupt systems or data.

## 📚 Common Types of Social Engineering Attacks

1. **Phishing** – Fake emails or sites to collect user data.
2. **Spear Phishing** – Targeted phishing using personal information.
3. **Baiting** – Malware-laced "freebies" like USB drives.
4. **Malware** – Trick users into installing malicious software.
5. **Pretexting** – Fake identity to extract information.
6. **Quid Pro Quo** – Offer help or service in exchange for info.
7. **Tailgating** – Gaining physical access via deception.
8. **Vishing** – Voice phishing to impersonate authorities.
9. **Water-Holing** – Infecting popular websites to target users.

## 🔁 How Social Engineering Works

1. **Preparation** – Research and information gathering.
2. **Infiltration** – Building trust.
3. **Exploitation** – Executing the attack.
4. **Disengagement** – Exiting after goal completion.

## 🧪 Phishing Simulation Using SET

### 💻 Environment:
- **OS**: Kali Linux
- **Tool**: Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)
- **Target**: Gmail Login Page (Credential Harvester)

### 🛠️ Simulation Steps:
1. Launch SET with root privileges.
2. Navigate to **Social-Engineering Attacks > Website Attack Vectors**.
3. Choose **Credential Harvester Attack Method**.
4. Select **Site Cloner**.
5. Enter attacker’s **local IP address**.
6. Clone the **Gmail login page**.
7. Host the fake page and wait for credential input.
8. View credentials logged by SET.
9. Stop the server after the test.

## ✅ Conclusion & Remediation Steps

Social engineering is a serious cybersecurity threat. Here are steps to prevent and mitigate attacks:

### 🔐 Defensive Strategies

1. **Regular Training** – Educate on phishing, vishing, and pretexting.
2. **Simulated Phishing Campaigns** – Test and improve user awareness.
3. **Reporting Mechanisms** – Encourage prompt incident reporting.
4. **Cybersecurity Culture** – Promote open discussions on security.
5. **Security Tools** – Use email filters and MFA.
6. **Access Controls** – Limit sensitive data access.
7. **Cybersecurity Ambassadors** – Internal role models for best practices.
8. **Physical Security Awareness** – Warn about tailgating and shoulder surfing.
9. **Continuous Learning** – Provide up-to-date educational resources.
